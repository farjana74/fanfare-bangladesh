        <p>Our Terms of Use have been updated as of 28 February 2017</p>
        <p>
          <strong>USER AGREEMENT</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Fanfare Holdings Limited (“Fanfare”) provides a video-sharing mobile
          app (the “App”) and related website located at{" "}
          <a href="http://fanfare.com.bd"> http://fanfare.com.bd</a> (the
          “Site”) — which include all of the text, images, audio, code and other
          material they contain or provide and all of the features, campaigns,
          contests, games and other services they provide (collectively, the
          “Content”). The App, the Site and any other features, tools,
          materials, or other services (including co-branded or affiliated
          services) offered from time to time by Fanfare are referred to here as
          the “Services.” Please read these Terms of Use (the “Terms” or “Terms
          of Use”) carefully before using the Services.
        </p>
        <p>
          By using or otherwise accessing the Services, or clicking to accept or
          agree to these Terms where that option is made available, you
        </p>
        <p>
          (1) accept and agree to these Terms and our additional campaign rules
          and gaming system; and
          <br />
          (2) consent to the collection, use, disclosure and other handling of
          information as described in our Privacy Policy; and
          <br />
          (3) any additional terms, rules and conditions of participation, in
          particular campaigns issued by Fanfare from time to time.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you do not agree to the Terms, then you may not access or use the
          Content or Services. Fanfare may issue additional terms, rules and
          conditions related to the use of the App and to participation in
          particular campaigns available on the App. You agree to be subject to
          them if you participate in such contests.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>ELIGIBILITY</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          You hereby represent and warrant that you are fully able and competent
          to enter into the terms, conditions, obligations, affirmations,
          representations and warranties set forth in the Terms and to abide by
          and comply with the Terms.
        </p>
        <p>
          By using the Services and/or entering a contest, you are representing
          and warranting that:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>you are of 13 years of age or older;</li>
          <li>
            you will abide at all times by these Terms of Use and any other
            agreements between you and Fanfare regarding your use of the
            Services or participation in games and contests;
          </li>
          <li>
            you are not an employee, operator or consultant of another
            video-sharing site when entering into any of Fanfare’s contests that
            awards prizes, rewards or credits;
          </li>
          <li>
            you do not have access to the Service’s pre-release non-public
            confidential data about contest-related information.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If Fanfare determines that you do not meet the eligibility
          requirements of this section, then you are not authorized to use the
          Services. Fanfare may require you to provide proof that you are
          eligible to participate according to this section prior to receiving a
          reward, prize or credit. This includes by requesting that you fill out
          an affidavit of eligibility or other verification information (as
          discussed in Section “Conditions of Registration” below). If Fanfare
          otherwise determines that you do not meet the eligibility requirements
          of this section, in addition to any rights that Fanfare may have in
          law or equity, Fanfare reserves the right to terminate your account,
          withhold or revoke the awarding of any rewards, prizes or credits
          associated with your account. In such a situation, Fanfare may pay out
          any withheld or revoked rewards, prizes or credits to the other
          entrants in the relevant contests in a manner consistent with the
          reward or prize structure of the contests, to be precisely determined
          by Fanfare in its sole discretion. Fanfare also reserves the right to
          withhold revoked rewards, prizes and credits to use in furtherance of
          its fraud prevention efforts. Fanfare employees may use the Services
          for the purpose of testing the user experience, but may not receive
          rewards, prizes or credits. Relatives of Fanfare employees with whom
          they share a household are not eligible to receive rewards, prizes or
          credits. Fanfare consultants or promoters of the Service may use the
          App and/or participate in the contests without such limitation, but
          only if:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            their arrangement with Fanfare does not permit them to have any
            access to non-public Service data or any other data not made
            available to all users on the Service and
          </li>
          <li>
            they do not receive any other advantages in their participation on
            the Service.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Business or brand owners or brand ambassadors may not participate in
          any Fanfare contests in the brand or brands with which they’re
          associated. Employees, technicians, their immediate family members and
          other individuals who through an ownership interest or brand-related
          employment can influence the campaign outcome are likewise ineligible.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>CONDITIONS OF PARTICIPATION</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Registration</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to use the App and/or participate in a campaign within the
          Services, you must register for an account. By registering as a user
          of the Services, you agree to provide accurate, current and complete
          information about yourself as prompted (such information being the
          “Registration Data”) and maintain and promptly update the Registration
          Data to keep it accurate, current and complete. If you provide any
          information that is inaccurate, not current or incomplete, or Fanfare
          has reasonable grounds to suspect that such information is inaccurate,
          not current or incomplete, Fanfare may deny you access to areas
          requiring registration, or terminate your account, at its sole
          discretion.
        </p>
        <p>
          You may establish, maintain, use and control only one account on the
          Service. Each account on the Service may only be owned, maintained,
          used and controlled by one individual. For avoidance of doubt, users
          may not “co-own” accounts on the Service. In the event Fanfare
          determines that you have opened, maintained, used or controlled more
          than one account, in addition to any other rights that Fanfare may
          have, Fanfare reserves the right to suspend or terminate any or all of
          your accounts and terminate, withhold or revoke the awarding of any
          rewards, prizes or credits.
        </p>
        <p>
          You agree that the sole and specific purpose of creating an account on
          Fanfare is to use the App and participate in video contests on the
          Service.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Communications and Information Practices</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          As a result of your registration for the Service, you may receive
          certain commercial communications from Fanfare. You understand and
          agree that these communications are part of your registration, and
          that, to the extent required by law, you may opt out of receiving
          these communications at any time by either using the unsubscribe
          functionality or sending an email to admin [at] Fanfare [dot] com
          [dot] bd . Following such an opt-out, we may still communicate with
          you via email to the extent permitted by applicable law, including
          without limitation updates to these Terms of Use. Opting out may cause
          you to miss announcements regarding the Service, results, prizes and
          other information
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Disqualification and Cancellation</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Fanfare also reserves the right to cancel campaigns, in our sole
          discretion, without any restrictions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fanfare, in its sole discretion, may disqualify you from a campaign or
          the entire Service, refuse to award game credits or rewards or prizes
          and require the return of any rewards or prizes, or suspend, limit, or
          terminate your account, if you engage in conduct that Fanfare deems,
          in its sole and absolute discretion, to be improper, unfair,
          fraudulent or otherwise adverse to the operations of the Service or in
          any way detrimental to other users. Improper conduct includes, but is
          not limited to: falsifying personal information required to use the
          Service or claim a reward or prize; accumulating points or rewards or
          prizes through unauthorized methods such as automated scripts or other
          automated means; tampering with the administration of the Service or
          trying to in any way tamper with the computer programs associated with
          the Service; obtaining other entrants’ information and spamming other
          entrants; abusing the Service in any way; or otherwise violating the
          Terms of Use. You acknowledge that the forfeiture and/or return of any
          reward or prize shall in no way prevent Fanfare from informing the
          relevant authorities, and/or pursuing criminal or civil proceedings in
          connection with such conduct.
        </p>
        <p>
          If for any reason the Service is not running as originally planned
          (e.g., if the Service becomes corrupted or does not allow the proper
          usage and processing of entries in accordance with the rules, or if
          infection by a computer virus, bugs, tampering, unauthorized
          intervention, actions by entrants, fraud, technical failures, or any
          other causes of any kind, in the sole opinion of Fanfare corrupts or
          affects the administration, security, fairness, integrity or proper
          conduct of the Service), Fanfare reserves the right, in its sole
          discretion, to disqualify any individual implicated in or relating to
          the cause and/or to cancel, terminate, extend, modify or suspend the
          Service, and select the winner(s) from all eligible entries received.
          If such cancellation, termination, modification or suspension occurs,
          notification may be posted on the Service or Site.
        </p>
        <p>
          The failure of Fanfare to comply with any provision of the Terms due
          to an act of God, hurricane, war, fire, riot, earthquake, terrorism,
          act of public enemies, actions of governmental authorities outside of
          the control of Fanfare (excepting compliance with applicable codes and
          regulations) or other force major event will not be considered a
          breach of these Terms.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Publicity</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          By using the App and/or entering a campaign, you consent to Fanfare’s
          and its service providers’ and business partners’ use of your name,
          voice, likeness, location photograph and videos posted in connection
          with the development, production, distribution and/or exploitation
          (including marketing and promotion) of the selected contest and/or
          other Fanfare contests and Fanfare generally, unless otherwise
          prohibited by law. Fanfare and its business partners reserve the right
          to make public statements about the entrants and winner(s), on-air, on
          the Internet, or otherwise, prior to, during, or following the
          contest. Entrants agree that Fanfare may announce any winner’s name
          on-air or online or on any of its websites or any other location at
          any time in connection with the marketing and promotion of Fanfare or
          other campaigns or activities or games operated by Fanfare. You agree
          that participation in and (where applicable) the winning of a reward
          or prize in connection with a campaign constitute complete
          compensation for your obligations under this paragraph, and you agree
          not to seek to charge a fee or impose other conditions on the
          fulfillment of these obligations. The rules specific to certain
          campaigns may contain additional publicity obligations or may require
          a written signature on a separate publicity waiver.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>CONTEST RULES</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Points</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Winners are determined by the criteria stated in each contest’s rules.
          For each contest, winners are determined by who accumulates the most
          points on the Service. Points are accumulated through the calculation
          of all values (positive and negative) associated to the actions
          performed by a User during a specific period of time over the course
          of the contest.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Contest Term</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Fanfare offers video contests for multiple brands, taking place
          throughout the year.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Rewards, Prizes, Game Credits</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          After each contest ends, the tentative winners are announced
          (generally by the following day) but remain subject to final
          verification. The participants in each contest who accumulate the most
          points and comply with eligibility requirements and applicable rules
          will win rewards, prizes and/or credits as set out in the post contest
          details. In the event of a tie, the prize is divided evenly between
          the tied participants, or similar rewards or prizes of equal value are
          provided to the tied participants, unless otherwise specified.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reward or prize calculations are based on the results as of the time
          when final stats are tabulated by Fanfare. Once winners are initially
          announced by Fanfare, we reserve the right to make adjustments based
          on errors or irregularities in the transmission of information to us
          from our stats provider or in our calculation of results. We also may
          make adjustments in the event of noncompliance with the Terms. Fanfare
          has no obligation to delay the awarding of a prize in anticipation of
          any adjustment.
        </p>
        <p>
          No substitution or transfer of a reward or prize is permitted. All
          taxes associated with the receipt or use of any reward or prize is the
          sole responsibility of the winner. In the event that the awarding of
          any reward or prize to winners of the campaign is challenged by any
          legal authority, Fanfare reserves the right in its sole discretion to
          determine whether or not to award or adjust such rewards or prizes. In
          all disputes arising out of the determination of the winner of Fanfare
          campaigns, Fanfare is the sole judge and its actions are final and
          binding.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Notification</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Winners are generally posted on the official Fanfare Facebook page
          after the conclusion of each campaign on the following day. Winners
          may also be notified by email. Winners may be requested to return via
          email or regular mail an affidavit of eligibility, a publicity
          agreement and appropriate tax forms by a specified deadline. Failure
          to comply with this requirement can result in disqualification. Any
          prize notification returned as undeliverable may result in
          disqualification and selection of an alternate winner. In addition, a
          list of winners and winners’ names for each campaign period may be
          obtained by writing to: <span></span>

          Violation of our rules may result in the removal of your Content from
          the Service and/or the cancelling of your account. You acknowledge and
          agree that Fanfare may remove any User Content (as defined below) and
          terminate any Fanfare account at any time for any reason (including,

        </p>
        <p>
          You understand that all Content made available on the Service by a
