          <p>
            Your privacy is important to us. Fanfare (“Fanfare”, “we” or “us”) has
            prepared this notice to explain our practices regarding the personal
            information we collect from users of our website located at
            http://www.fanfare.global (the “Website”), our mobile application
            (“Application”), and video-sharing related services available through
            the Website and Application (“Services”). This notice does not apply
            to websites, applications, or services that do not display or link to

            <strong>Information You Provide to Us</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            By accepting this Privacy Policy, you expressly consent that we may
            collect personal information from you, such as your age group, gender,
            first and last name, location, email address, username and password,
            and the country and state in which you reside when you create an
            account to log in to our network (“Account”). If you use our
            Application on your mobile device, we may collect your phone number
            and unique device id number. If you provide us feedback or contact us
            via email, we will collect your name and email address, as well as any
            other content included in the email, in order to send you a reply. We
            will collect your profile photo and username that you upload to your
            public profile page (“Profile”). When you participate in any poll,
            game or other video-sharing related contests on the Services (each a
            “Contests”) other participants in the Contest (each, a “Participant”)
            will be able to see the information in your Profile. If you tell us
            where you are (e.g., by allowing your mobile device to send us your
            location), we may store and use that information to verify for
            eligibility to enter certain Contests and for fraud prevention
            purposes. If you participate in a campaign or giveaway on our
            Services, we may ask you for your email address and/or mobile number
            (to notify you whether you win or not). We may also ask for first and
            last names, mobile, and post office addresses to verify your identity.
            In some situations, we may need additional information as part of the
            entry process, such as a reward or prize selection choice, or in
            connection with the award of rewards and/or prizes over a certain
            wallet balance in monetary value. These contests and games are
            voluntary. We recommend that you read the rules for each contest that
            you enter. We may also collect information at other points in our
            Website and Services where it is clear we are collecting such
            information.

            <strong>HOW WE RESPOND TO ‘DO NOT TRACK’ SIGNALS</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Some web browsers may transmit “do not track” signals to the websites
            and other online services with which your web browser communicates.
            There is no standard that governs what, if anything, websites should
            do when they receive these signals. We currently do not take action in
            response to these signals. If and when a standard is established, we
            may revise our policy on responding to these signals.
